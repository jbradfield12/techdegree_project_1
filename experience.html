        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>My experience is a bit limited. I am a student currently trying to nail down the basics. I have
          a little bit of school under my belt. I have taken some IT courses at Trevecca University in
          Nashville, TN. We learned a little bit about everything from project management, to hardware and
          networking, to HTML, CSS and Photoshop. It was just enough to wet my beak some but not fully grasp any
          of the individual aspects. I am looking forward to really diving in here on Treehouse and mastering it all.</p>
        <p>While I may be lacking in coding experience, I know that my hard work ethic will carry me through
          these courses and ultimately get myself where I want to be. I am ready for the challenge!</p>
