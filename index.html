        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I am a student seeking a new career in web development as well as a new path in this world.
          I've spent the majority of my life punching a clock, passing the time away and not doing anything
          to challenge myself. I've always had a creative/artistic mind in my personal life but never
          at my place of work. I am looking to change that and approach work with a new skillset and a
          renewed passion.</p>
        <p>I enjoy music, sports, hiking, and am trying to become a better cook. I consider myself a big
          foodie and am excited to explore this new town and see what all it has to offer.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>My goals are to master my skillset in web-building and design, and eventually become a freelance
          designer. I would like to do so by becoming proficient in the following:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>Ruby</li>
          <li>Rails</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I love giving structure and life to a site and getting creative with it to make it stand out in a
          major way that is sure to catch the eye!</p>
